You have a few options:

   services in the same way we have here.
2. Fork this project and customize it to your own liking, and use that as a
   submodule.
3. Use the files in this project ad-hoc, verbatim, or at-will within your own
   project.

* Customize the provided `Dockerfile` if you've got additional things that need
  to happen.
